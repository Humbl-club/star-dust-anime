# API Integration Plan

## Current Status
✅ **MyAnimeList (Jikan API)** - Currently implemented
- Official public API for MyAnimeList
- Good data quality but basic image resolution
- Rate limited (3 requests/second)

## Proposed API Integrations

### 1. AniList API (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) ⭐
**Why AniList?**
- **Superior image quality** - High-resolution covers and banners
- **GraphQL API** - More flexible and efficient data fetching
- **Better metadata** - More comprehensive character, staff, and studio info
- **Real-time updates** - More current data than MAL
- **No rate limits** for reasonable usage
- **Better English/Romaji title handling**

**Implementation Benefits:**
- 4K quality cover images
- Banner images for hero sections
- Character profiles with high-res images
- Better genre and tag system
- Streaming platform links
- More accurate release dates

### 2. Streaming Platform APIs

#### Official APIs (Recommended):
- **Crunchyroll Store Locator API** (Limited but official)
- **Funimation API** (Now part of Crunchyroll)
- **Netflix API** (Partner access only)

#### Alternative Approaches:
Instead of reverse-engineered APIs (which violate ToS), consider:
- **JustWatch API** - Legal streaming availability
- **Simkl API** - Streaming links aggregator
- **Kitsu.io API** - Another anime database with streaming info

### 3. Additional APIs for Enhanced Features

#### **TMDB (The Movie Database)**
- High-quality posters and backdrops
- Trailer videos (YouTube links)
- International release info
- Better synopsis translations

#### **Kitsu.io API**
- Alternative data source
- Good for cross-referencing
- Different rating system perspective

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: AniList Integration
1. Add AniList GraphQL client
2. Create dual-source data fetching (MAL + AniList)
3. Prioritize AniList images when available
4. Implement GraphQL caching

### Phase 2: Enhanced Visuals
1. Fetch high-res images from AniList
2. Add banner/backdrop images
3. Implement image optimization/caching
4. Add character and staff sections

### Phase 3: Streaming Integration
1. Integrate JustWatch for legal streaming links
2. Add "Watch Now" buttons
3. Regional availability display
4. Price comparison for rentals/purchases

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Character profiles with images
2. Staff information (directors, studios)
3. Episode guides
4. Recommendation engine improvements

## Security & Legal Considerations

❌ **AVOID Reverse-Engineered APIs:**
- Violate Terms of Service
- Can break without notice
- Legal liability
- IP infringement risks

✅ **USE Official/Sanctioned APIs:**
- Stable and supported
- Legal compliance
- Better long-term maintenance
- Professional credibility
